DCGN is a message passing interface for heterogeneous clusters utilizing CPUs and GPUs. DCGN provides a mechanism and an API that promotes GPUs to first-class network citizens. Using DCGN, any GPU can communicate with any other GPU or CPU (CPUs can also communicate with other CPUs) using an API similar to MPI. DCGN provides  synchronous and asynchronous point-to-point communication functions, as well as synchronous collective communication abilities.
